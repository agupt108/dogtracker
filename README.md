 
 Most dog trackers are really expensive + a subscription if gps tech. The cheaper non subscription modules are bluetooth, limiting their range to around 300 m. However, using **LoRa**, we can create a relatively inexpensive GPS tracker that sends location data to a server, processing it and sending it to a phone as a IOS push notifications. LoRa, or Long Range Radio, is a long range wireless data transfer technique that communicates up to 10-15 km on a standard model. Higher end models can communicate up to 716 km. The **RYLR890/96**(either is good) module by Reyax is a very good for this project, because it has a good range of 10-15 km. Two are neeed to make a wireless data transfer, in this case between a dog tracker module and a main module. The data that we will be transferring is the dog's location, which will be found using a GPS module (in this case **GPS Neo-6M, GT-U7, around $12.97 from Amazon**). This data will be send through the LoRa module to the LoRa reciever which will put the data on the server which will be created. This server will then send a push notification using the Prowl app (IoS) which will notify you when dog leaves a certain area. A link will also be provided to view the dog's location on the server link as an <iframe> of google maps with the dog as a point. The case to inclose the dog tracker will be 3-d printed (suprisingly, the cheapest option, around $3-4 for a good quality case).
